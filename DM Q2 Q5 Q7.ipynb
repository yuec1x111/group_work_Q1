    "# Assignment 1\n",
    "The assignment is accompanied by a setup notebook that contains boilerplate code for each exercise. Some of the answers depend on a particular dataset split or seed, so consult the boilerplate code for specifics even if you would like to program everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we strongly encourage you to use NumPy for your implementations. While scikit-learn provides convenient implementations of many algorithms, we recommend implementing the core algorithms from scratch using NumPy for several important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Educational Value**: Implementing algorithms from scratch deepens your understanding of the underlying mathematics and computational principles. You'll gain insight into the inner workings that you might miss when using high-level libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control and Transparency**: NumPy gives you precise control over your implementations without the hidden complexity that can exist in scikit-learn's optimized code. This transparency is crucial for debugging and understanding exactly what your code is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoiding Implementation Pitfalls**: If you do choose to use scikit-learn, please be extremely careful. The library contains many implementation details, optimizations, and default parameters that can significantly affect your results. These details are not always obvious from the documentation and can lead to incorrect conclusions if not properly understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to use scikit-learn despite this recommendation, please thoroughly read the documentation and understand all parameters and their effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Note On Using Language Models\n",
    "As a student in the age of AI, you have without a doubt used language models to study course material, answer questions or even solve assignments for you. Using other sources than the course material to learn is valuable indeed, but a word of caution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of these exercises is for you to develop as an engineer and as a scientist. Using language models to directly answer the question might get you through the assignment, but it is liable to damage your development in the long run. In the end **someone needs to understand what the model is talking about in order to validate the outcomes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite likely you will not end up designing gradient descent algorithms for a living. But do not confuse the specifics of this problem set with the broader educational value of **solving a difficult problem yourself from start to finish**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Education is about more than gaining skills. It is also about a work ethic, a way of approaching problems, scientific rigor, managing your thought process, using the tools at your disposal and recognizing where your strengths and weaknesses lie. Using language models heedlessly runs the risk of depriving you of the opportunity to struggle through that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can only ask you to adopt more responsibility for your education yourself. Consider not denying yourself the challenge and pressure necessary for growth, and instead use the tools you have to deepen your understanding. In the end, the responsibility is yours."

Even though you do not strictly need to do so to answer the question, consider using visualizations and summary statistics to explore relationships between variables and prices. Are any features clearly predictive? Are there outliers or skewed distributions? Consider how these factors might affect modeling later on.

Large feature values produce large squared terms, which can cause issues during optimization. In practice, this results in warnings about ill-conditioned matrices. To avoid this, you’ll standardize the original data using `StandardScaler` before generating polynomial features.\n",

By systematically training and evaluating on different subsets of the data, you can better understand how well your models generalize and reduce the risk of making decisions based on a particular \"lucky\" or \"unlucky\" split.\n",
